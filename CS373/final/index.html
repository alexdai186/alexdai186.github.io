<br>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you like the least about the class?</h2>
<p>
	I least liked how late the grading was. Sometimes, we wouldn't get our evaluations until a few 
	hours before the next iteration was due, giving us not enough time to fix our mistakes. Thankfully, the grading was very lenient, and we weren't punished too hard for repeated mistakes. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you like the most about the class?</h2>
<p> 
	What I liked the most about the class was all of the neat Python tricks I learned from the lecture. Professor Downing has a great knowledge of the inner workings of Python. His lectures greatly strengthened my fundamentals in producing clean, efficient, python code. Some of the most useful things I learned were using lambda expressions and generators in my code. During my final round interview with Amazon, my interviewer said he was very impressed by my knowledge of python and the clean code I had produced, and soon afterwards, I got the offer! I can credit a large portion of that success to knowledge I obtained in this class. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's the most significant thing you learned?</h2>
<p>
	How to write clean, efficient code. I liked the refactoring portion because it gave me a lot of insight on how to write producion code. A lot of the times, I would be writing code, and I would get this feeling that the code I'm writing is absolute spaghetti, but I didn't know how I was supposed to improve it. The refactoring portion of the class taught me a lot of techniques and strategies to reduce redundancies in code and make writing code that needed to be updated less of a nightmare than before. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?</h2>
<p> 
	I spent about 6-8 hours coding a week. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?</h2>
<p>
	I spent about 1-2 hours a week reading. I should have read more for the class, but sometimes, I couldn't find the time to read. The quizzes weren't usually about the readings either, so sometimes, I got away with not doing the reading. 
</p>
<h2>How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</h2>
<p>
	I wrote 600-700 lines of code. 
</p>
<h2>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</h2>
<p>
	I think that TravisCI is very useful for automating unit tests. I will definitely use this tool in the future for any side projects I have that will require the use of automated tests. 
</p>
<h2>What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</h2>
<p>
	The most useful Web development tool that wasn't required that we used was reactstrap. Though I didn't directly contribute to the parts that required it, all the members in my group who directly interacted with it enjoyed it a lot. 
</p>
<h2>If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</h2>
<p>
	If I could change one thing about this course, I would make the quizzes a little bit easier.
