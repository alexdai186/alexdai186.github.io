<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week I was very busy with exams in my Data Mining Class. I had to finish a project for the class due Tuesday, and I had to study for a midterm in the test the following Thursday. I think I did pretty badly on the test, so I got to pick it up in the next few weeks so I don't flunk out of things. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I will have to focus on catching up in all of my classes and not fail out of school. I have done a poor job of keeping up with things, and I really need to put some time into school and do well. <br>
	I also need to run a lot more because I will be running the longhorn run, and I am absolutely terrible at running. I need to be able to run a 5k, so I need to hit the treadmill at least 5 more times between now and then. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week, I will need to put a lot of time into the iDB2 problem, because I haven't tried hard enough in it at all. I need to figure out more of the database things, as well as try to contact my partners so they can catch me up on things. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of the class has been good, I worried about getting enough 5/5 on my quizzes, and I'm hoping that the professor will offer way more quiz opportunities than the 30 needed to count for the grade. I am excited to begin the lectures about SQL and database management. One of the concepts in class helped me catch a bug that would have taken me hours in the past to find out.
	<br>
	I hope that the blog isn't actually being graded harshly, because I've been putting almost zero effort into learning how to make this stuff pretty. Though it isn't too hard, I really need to devote a weekend or two into making a pretty website for myself. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to plan ahead whenever you're doing something because if you're like me, you're never gonna be productive enough if you try to wing it. By planning ahead and setting goals, you'll be less likely to take the easy way out when it comes down to it.
