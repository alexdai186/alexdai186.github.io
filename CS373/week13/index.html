<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week, I basically did nothing except work on my data mining project. It was about determining whether people had seizures based on some scientifically gathered data. I also "finished" my part in our software engineering project. 
	<br>
	I also went fishing with my best friend, Bill. We ate Cicis Pizza afterward and it was all you can eat deliciousness for only $5.99!
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I have a cumulative final in my applied linear algebra class. I need to learn everything because I need a 100 on it to get an A in the class. I also found out that I'm allergic to shrimp after eating it at Oasis. This is a HUGE problem, because shrimp is my third favorite kind of crustacean, and I was looking forward to eating it at Sushi Bang Bang this week.  
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week, I have to study for my applied linear algebra test. I also want to work out more, because I am getting soft, which is unacceptable. Summer is approaching, and I need my bod back!! I am also planning to start making monthly donations to a few of my favorite charities.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of this class is pretty good, but I miss Professor Downing! I am excited to do well on the test next week, because I feel like I am very prepared. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to take advantage of promotions that restaurants put out, like "one free entree when you download our app", because it is a great way to save money. Also, when going to all you can eat buffets, it is important to fast for at least 10 hours beforehand and to avoid drinking water in order to maximize stomach space. When eating all you can eat sushi, you should order before you finish the current round of food because the servers will intentionally take forever in the hope that you get full before you can order again.
