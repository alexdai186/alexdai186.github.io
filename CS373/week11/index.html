<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week, I need to prepare for my Amazon final interview on Friday. Gotta look at a lot of leetcode problems as well as brush up on my Data Structures and Algorithms. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This next week I will try to catch up on all of my homework and also run a lot more because the Longhorn Run is in 2 weeks, and I need to run a lot more in preparation. I'm running 2.5 miles ont he treadmill pretty consistently, but the Longhorn run is a 5k, which is 3.1 miles and also got uphill/downhills and winding turns throughout the city that I will need to account for. 

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>

	This upcoming week, I'm swamped with a lot of projects and tests that I need to do. One such project is iDB3, and since I Was on the backend side of things, I need to learn React and JS and all that jazz. Fun!
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	I hope that the blog isn't actually being graded harshly, because I've been putting almost zero effort into learning how to make this stuff pretty. Though it isn't too hard, I really need to devote a weekend or two into making a pretty website for myself. 
	<br>
	I need to make sure I ace all of the next quizzes.

<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to use Leetcode to practice coing interview problems. It's got a great library of problems that cover all of the possible topics companies can ask you, from binary search trees to linked lists to dynamic programming. In addition, it's got company specific questions, that is, questions that are closely linked to certain companies. Amazon might ask different types of question at a different frequency than Facebook, and so it really helps to make your studying more efficient and directed towards the company of choice. 
	<br>
	The final advantage of using Leetcode over other competitors like Hackerrank is that it handles all of the input processing for you. One of the biggest annoyances I have with Hackerrank is that I probably spend 5-10 minutes per problem just mapping out the input parsing logic, something that is both redundant and useless for interviewing. Leetcode just has you implement a method, making its user experience much more enjoyable and streamlined. Check it out!
