<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week I was very busy with exams in Declarative and in my Math classes. Thankfully, the rest of the week after that was very chill, and I was able to relax a bit. I also had an interview with Amazon that I studied for a lot, but I messed up one of the coding problems in the online assessment and I feel terrible. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I'm swamped with a lot of projects and tests that I need to do. One such project is iDB3, and since I Was on the backend side of things, I need to learn React and JS and all that jazz. Fun!
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week I will try to catch up on all of my homework and also run a lot more because the Longhorn Run is in 2 weeks, and I need to run a lot more in preparation. I'm running 2.5 miles ont he treadmill pretty consistently, but the Longhorn run is a 5k, which is 3.1 miles and also got uphill/downhills and winding turns throughout the city that I will need to account for. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	I hope that the blog isn't actually being graded harshly, because I've been putting almost zero effort into learning how to make this stuff pretty. Though it isn't too hard, I really need to devote a weekend or two into making a pretty website for myself. 
	<br>
	My experience of the class has been good, I worried about getting enough 5/5 on my quizzes, and I'm hoping that the professor will offer way more quiz opportunities than the 30 needed to count for the grade. I am excited to begin the lectures about SQL and database management. One of the concepts in class helped me catch a bug that would have taken me hours in the past to find out.
	<br>
	I need to make sure I ace all of the next quizzes.

<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to plan ahead whenever you're doing something because if you're like me, you're never gonna be productive enough if you try to wing it. By planning ahead and setting goals, you'll be less likely to take the easy way out when it comes down to it.
