<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week I worked on my Data Mining project. I had to create a Naive Bayes Classifier as well as a k-nearest-neighbor classifier over a set of medical data to create a model that can predict whether a patient has diabetic retinopathy (blindness caused by diabetes). I really enjoy Data Science, so the project was very enjoyable as a whole. I also worked on studying for my Math test, which turned out to be very easy. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	What's in my way for this upcoming week is the software engineering test on Thursday. My Javascript skills are not so sharp, so I hope that they will be sufficient in the upcoming test. My python skills are decent, so that shouldn't be a problem. I just need to be barely proficient in JavaScript so that I can translate the paradigms from python into JS. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week I will study for this upcoming test I have in Software Engineering. I will also try to finish all of my competitive programming Homework on time. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	So far, my experience of the class has been great. I'm learning a lot about programming paradigms in both JavaScript and Python. I think more should be taught about database design and what we've been reading outside of class. I haven't been able to review the material or connect in a higher level way yet, so I hope we get more into the SQL and Backend stuff once we finish this next test. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to related to making guacamole. When you dice your tomatoes, onions, and garlic, it helps to put them into a food processor or a blender of some sort before you mix it in with the avacodoes. The reason for this is becaue the food processor gets the veggies really finely diced, while also squeezing a lot of juice out of the mixture. <br>
	The reason why I do this is because I used to always get bites of guacamole that was one full piece of garlic or something like that, and would ruin some of the morsels of guac I ate. By processing the veggies, you ensure that the vegetables are finely chopped. Also, the juice that comes out allows you to better distribute the flavor across the entirety of the guacamole. 
	<br>
	Give it a try next time you are making guacamole!
