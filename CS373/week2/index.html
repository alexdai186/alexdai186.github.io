<h3 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h3>
<p>
This week I worked a lot on the Collatz project, namely setting up all of the 
tools and dependencies we will be using in the future. I'm glad the professor 
assigned a relatively easy problem for us to solve, because all of the setup 
(Looking at you, Travis CI) took a considerable amount of time to solve. 
At the end of the day, though, I'm glad I spent my time on learning these 
these tools in a classroom setting, because if I had to set up Travis CI 
on my own for say an independent project, I would have gave up. 
<h3 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h3>
<p> 
I still need to get the third Collatz test working. I have some error 
in my code that is giving me a wrong answer for test 3 and I cannot for 
the life of me find out where it is. HELP!"

<h3 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
<p> 
I have been enjoying the class a lot so far. I got wrecked by the quizzes 
this past week because I forgot to read, so hopefully this next week should 
go better because I will be more prepared. The tools we have been using 
I think will be very helpful to me in the future, namely the automated 
testing software, Travis CI. It's super convienent once you get all the 
stupid setup learning curve over with, and I believe it should make 
testing super easy for me. <br><br>
I got called on for the first time in lecture to answer a question and 
it was nerve-wracking. Thankfully, I was able to answer his questions to 
some degree of correctness. Sometimes I feel like the professor calls on 
someone just so they can listen to him explain something, as opposed 
to answering a hard question or something, which I like.

<h3 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h3>
<p>
My tip of the week is to do all the readings before the week starts because 
it seems like the quizzes are less common sense stuff and just reading checks. 
If you can't find the time to read all of the material thoroughly, I would 
suggest finding friends and creating a google doc of summaries of the readings. 
You could potentially switch off every week so that one person does all of the 
readings and summarizes it for the rest of the people. This way, you can still 
get the big picture ideas and concepts the reading is supposed to convey in a 
more time friendly and collaborative way.
