<h1 style="text-align:center">CS373 Spring 2018: Alex Dai</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This week I worked on studying for the software engineering test on Thursday. I didn't expect it to be very hard, but I ended up studying pretty hard for it anyway. I think it was well worth it because the test had a some tricky parts, and I felt like I was well prepared to tackle them. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I have a Data Mining project to finish, as well as a Data Science test I need to study for. After that, it's smooth sailing! Mainly because, I plan on buying a fishing kayak for the break and fish a lot over the break. I've primarily had to fish for the shore, which has severely limited the amount of water I can cover while fishing. Thankfully with this kayak, I should be able to cover almost any place imaginable. I know that Austin has some great fishing opportunities, and some record size bass hiding in Ladybird Lake, so I'm excited to be able to try to fish some of them out this spring break! 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week, I will study for the aforementioned test and project. Furthermore, I will try to contribute more to the iDB project due the week after spring break. I need to finish implementing the youtube scraper for multimedia content that we need, as well as implement the database to work with the API for our website well. I think working with APIs is really cool, and am loving how useful it will be to me in future projects. This class has been great in teaching me how to use certain tools. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of the class has been good, I worried about getting enough 5/5 on my quizzes, and I'm hoping that the professor will offer way more quiz opportunities than the 30 needed to count for the grade. I am excited to begin the lecture about SQL and database management. One of the concepts in class helped me catch a bug that would have taken me hours in the past to find out.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week this week is to try thrift shopping because it's very fun and you could fine a cool piece of clothing for pennies on the dollar. Besides clothes, one of the most underrated aspects of thrift stores is the books. You can get quality books for like 5 for a dollar, and a large portion of the time, they will be unread and just like new.
