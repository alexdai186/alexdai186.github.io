<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
This week I worked with my group on starting the iDB1 project. We decided to make an application that included models of hiking trails in Colorado, ski resorts in Colorado, and images of the trails and resorts in Colorado, which I am super excited about. One of our teammates, Robert, seems to have a lot of experience with the trails and resorts in the area, which is good because he should know what information is pertinent to hikers and skiiers, and can make our application very practical. 
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
I need to learn more about making pretty webpages and get to work on designing the trails pages, which I was tasked with. I will probably have to put in a decent amount of time on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before the due date. Unfortunately, I also have a Declarative Programming test that I need to study or that is also on Thursday, so balancing those two things might be an issue. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
I will need to learn more about HTML and CSS and JavaScript in order to make my trails pages functinal and pretty to boot. Thankfully the pages are static pages, so I won't need to mess with much JavaScript for now.

<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
My experience of the class is meh so far this week. We spent 1 whole class period figuring out group members, which was kind of annoying because I felt like that could have been handled outside of class. Furthermore, the other two lectures were spent going over little python tricks and tips, most of which I already knew. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
My tip of the week is to be aware of the "sunk cost" mindset that people get whenever they are developing solution to problems they have. 
<br>
Many times, people start off with a certain methodology, and after spending a decent amount of time pursuing that solution, they realize that the solution is inherently flawed or not the best solution for the problem. Unfortunately, they are unwilling to abandon their current solution because of the amount of time they've spent on it. 
<br>
Make yourself aware of the fact that the time spent on the past doesn't have any tangible value. If there is a better solution, or if he solution you currently have just isn't good for you, then you should resolve to abandon it without any second thought. Sometimes this is hard because of the emotional investment you might make with a solution, be it pride or whatever else, but if you keep wasting time because of those reasons, you'll only look back at it in the future with regret and confusion as to why you were so stubborn at the time.
