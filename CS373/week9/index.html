<h1 style="text-align:center">CS373 Spring 2018: Alex Dai</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This week I forgot to do my weekly blog, so I'm redoing it 2 weeks after it was due. 
	I believe this week I worked a lot on iDB1, trying to get all of the pages linked and the 
	model unified. Getting TravisCI working was super tedious, and took almost 20 commits to finally get everything
	running. It was the same way for my Collatz project. For sch small projects like these, setting up TravisCI is so much more trouble than it is worth. Fortunately, these initial learning curve steps should be easy to overcome, and should provide for easier access in the future. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I believe I had to ace a Declarative test, as well as an Applied Linear Algebra test. Unfortunately, I did pretty terribly on both tests, and I feel like I'm gonna ralph under all the stress. 
	Why do I suck so much?
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week, I need to study hard on y tests and hopefully try to get good grades in them.  I am a corn. I have a gluten allergy, but I eat wheat anyway. 
	my favorite fruit is pineapple. I hate peaches. Peaches don't talk. or walk for that matter. Hee HAh!
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of the class has been good, I worried about getting enough 5/5 on my quizzes, and I'm hoping that the professor will offer way more quiz opportunities than the 30 needed to count for the grade. I am excited to begin the lectures about SQL and database management. One of the concepts in class helped me catch a bug that would have taken me hours in the past to find out.
	<br>
	I hope that the blog isn't actually being graded harshly, because I've been putting almost zero effort into learning how to make this stuff pretty. Though it isn't too hard, I really need to devote a weekend or two into making a pretty website for myself. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to plan ahead whenever you're doing something because if you're like me, you're never gonna be productive enough if you try to wing it. By planning ahead and setting goals, you'll be less likely to take the easy way out when it comes down to it.
