<h1 style="text-align:center">CS373 Spring 2018: Alex Dai</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
	This past week I've been anxiously waiting for feedback on my interview I had on Monday. I had a really chill 
	week since all my midterms finished up, but instead of catching up on my classes, I basically just refreshed my email waiting for the result for a week. Luckily, it worked, and I got the offer! 
	<br>
	I also ran the 5k at the Longhorn run on Saturday and it was really fun! Coming from someone who hated running for his entire life, I actually enjoyed the race, and would definitely recommend it. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	This upcoming week, I gotta contribute to my groups iDB4 iteration, because I've been a bit of a slacker this past iteration. I also got to finish my Declarative homework due Thursday. I really hate that class. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	This next week, I'm am definitely going to try to hit the gym more because I've been slipping with that. I also got to watch my Houston Rockets decimate the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA Playoffs. All of my hard midterms are coming up soon, so I know I Should be studying hard to make my life easier for future Alex, but it's just so hard to work without deadlines breating down your neck. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of this class is pretty good. I enjoy the SQL stuff we're learning right now, and I also enjoy the OOP Design principles that Downing is teaching us. I feel like a lot of these concepts are borrowed from his OOP class as well, which is a plus and a minus. It's a plus because it's very important to learn about and relevant to my career, but the downside because I feel like there's less of an incentive to take OOP next season because of the material overlap. Regardless, I am enjoying it. Hopefully the test won't be too difficult. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My pick of the week is to use numpy whenever you need to do numerical analysis in Python. It's a great library for manipulating large amounts of data in that it provides very efficient library methods, as well as an array of useful functions that will save hours off your life. All you have to do is pip install numpy and import it into your programs and you'll have a super powerful library at your fingertips!
