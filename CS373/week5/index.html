<h2 style="text-align:center">What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>
This past week, we finished up iDB1. I learned a decent amount of front end CSS and web page layouts, which I am pretty excited for. My page looks pretty decent, and I'm proud of my work. I also had my Declarative Programming class that I had a test in. In retrospect, I studied way too much for it because the question were straight from the textbook, and it was also open note. Oh well, it's better to be safe than sorry. 
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's in your way?</h2>
<p> 
	What's currently in my way is a applied linear algebra test I have on Tuesday. Furthermore, the career fair is also on Tuesday, so I have to prep my resume and brush up some of my speaking skills. I've definitely been super lazy this week, but it's ok because after Tuesday should be pretty smooth sailing for me. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What will you do next week?</h2>
<p>
	Next week I will definitely put more effort on my blog, and also catch up on reading and what not. I feel like I've been falling way behind in my competitive programming class so far, so I definitely need to spend a few hours and catch up. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my experience of the class?</h2>
<p> 
	My experience of this class was great this week. I really enjoyed the peer presentation we made in class. It was helpful trying to explain our product and its use cases to another team. It really made us grasp our own product better and helped us learn the improvements we had to make in order for it to be a helpful and useful product. On the flipside, being a consumer allowed us to also see what was and wasn't working in another team's product. From their product, we learned that embedding other multimedia aspects, such as videos and twitter feeds into our pages weren't too difficult to do, and really added a layer of depth to our own product. All in all, I really enjoyed the class this week and believed it to be super helpful the future. 
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">What's my tip-of-the-week?</h2>
<p>
	My tip of the week is directed to all of those people out there that like to waste time and watch youtube clips of movies you've already seen 100 times. That's what I did this weekend, and I feel bad for being so unproductive. One of the hardest things for me is pushing myself to do work if I'm already on schedule. I find it really hard to do stuff without the pressure of an immediate deadline breathing down my neck. 
	<br> 
	My tip is to set yourself up for productivity. It's hard to do work when you wake up at 2pm and are trying to do homework while in bed. Make sure your environment and your mindset is ok when you do it. That means waking up at a reasonable hour, and putting yourself in an environment that stimulates productivity, whether that be a library, or even just a desk where you can't lie down.
