<h1>CS373 Spring 2018: Alex Dai</h1>
<p>I'm sorry this blog is trash right now. </p>

<h3>
	What are your expectations of the class?
</h3>
<p> 
	I expect to learn alot about software engineering fundamenals from this class 
from high-level concepts such as creating great user experiences and writing 
maintainable and understandable code, to the low-level ones such as understanding 
the workings of programming languages such as HTML, Python, and JavaScript. 

I have heard that this class is rather time intensive, and I'm looking forward 
to creating a project with other teammates that I can be proud to call my own. 
</p>

<h3>
	What did you do this past week?
</h3>
<p>
	This past week I was looking for the class textbooks as well as learning HTML 
to get this blog created. 
</p>

<h3>
	What's in your way?
</h3>
<p>
	I know Python pretty well, however I have no prior experience in HTML or Javascript, so 
learning those tools will be a challenge for me. 

I also have little experience working in a team outside of pair programming assignments in 
prior CS classes. Therefore, I am excited to learn more about team dynamics and working 
together and providing value in our own ways to jointly push out projects. 
</p>

<h3>
	What will you do next week?
</h3>
<p>
	Next week I will do the homework of this class and perhaps make this ugly blog 
post a little better looking. 
</p>

<h3>
	What's my experience of the class?
</h3>
<p>
	So far so good. I enjoy the lecture style and I also am interested in the content of the material. 
</p>

<h3>
	What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
</h3>
<p>
	My tip of the week is to slow down when fishing in cold weather. I haven't caught any fish 
in the month of January and I think I need to stop retrieving my baits so fast because 
the fish are slow and lethargic in the winter and don't want to expend much energy chasing 
fast moving baits in the winter.
